# NeuralNet_BackPropVisualization
This neural network tool visualizes the weight matrix dynamics during the training of a simple neural network on various logic gates (XOR, AND, OR).

Select a logic gate from the drop-down at anytime to switch the training direction of the network. Pick a time step over which to iterate during training.
